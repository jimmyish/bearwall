.SH NAME
@PKGNAME@ \- front-end script for configuring an iptables firewall

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bearwall [OPTION]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B @PKGNAME@
script, when run, reads its configuration files and sets up appropriate
iptables(8) chains and rules.
.PP
The only options currently supported are the following informative options.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display help
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
display current version
.PP
.SH FILES
The following directory contains files that need to be modified/created
for your server.
.\" indent paragraph with label
.TP
.I @CONFDIR@/interfaces.d/*.if
The
.B interfaces.d
directory contain a file for each interface you want
configured. Typically you would create a symlink (for example, named
.IR eth0.if )
that points to one of the templates in classes.d (such as
.IR external )
if you want to use one of the defaults.

.PP
The following directories do not need to be modified unless you
want to change the default behaviour of the
.BR firewall .

.TP 
.I @CONFDIR@/classes.d/*
The
.B classes.d
directory contains templates for different types of interfaces. Example
templates include
.IR external ,
.IR internal ,
.I loopback
and
.IR vpn .

.TP
.I @CONFDIR@/hosts.d/*.host
The files in the
.B hosts.d
directory provide rules that apply to all packets on all interfaces.
This may be useful if you want to do "type of service" differentiation.
All these files will be loaded automatically each time the
.B @PKGNAME@
script is run.

.TP
.I @BASEDIR@/ruleset.d/*.rule
The files in the
.B ruleset.d
directory specify default rules (for example, accepting/denying traffic on
particular ports) for use in the
.I *.if
interface files. See the following section for more details on the default
rule-sets.


.SH RULES
.B Default Rule-sets
.TP
.I classify.rule
Classifies traffic where qualities (eg interactive, bulk) can be
guessed from port numbers.
.TP
.I icmp\-strict.rule
Rejects incoming ICMP packets.

.TP 
.I icmp\-trust.rule
Allows all ICMP packets. Use if you trust the network that this interface is
attached to.

.TP 
.I martians.rule
Reject packets with a source address in private RFC1918 space.

.TP 
.I multicast\-strict.rule
Only allow packets on multicast addresses if they are IGMP.

.TP 
.I multicast\-trust.rule
Like multicast\-strict, but additionally allows OSPF routing packets.
This assumes that you trust the network that this interface is attached to.

.TP 
.I tcp\-strict.rule
Disallow incoming TCP packets except for established connections (that is,
connections started locally).

.TP 
.I tcp\-trust.rule
Allows all incoming TCP packets.
.\" except for certain ports?

.TP 
.I udp\-strict.rule
Only allows UDP packets in the dynamically generated port range 1024-5000.

.TP 
.I udp\-trust.rule
Allows most UDP packets. Disallowed ports include TFTP, RPC, and NFS-related.

.PP
.B Other rules

.TP
polite_reject
Reject these packets, with "polite" logging (only log up to 2 packets per
second instead of logging every packet to syslog).

.TP
polite_drop
Drop these packets, with "polite" logging (as above).


.SH INTERFACE RULES
This describes the syntax of the rules in the
.I interface.d/*.if
files.
.TP
.B policy
.I chain
.I action
.br .\" line break
where
.I chain
is one of
.BR in ,
.BR out ,
.BR forward-in ,
or
.BR forward-out ,
and
.I action
is one of
.I named rule-set
(without the ".rule"),
.BR ACCEPT ,
.B REJECT
or
.BR DENY .
.br
ACCEPT, REJECT and DENY can also be followed by standard iptables(8) rule
options (such as \-\-protocol
.IR n ).

.TP
.B if_feature
.I feature
.I value
.br
where feature is one of the settings supported by your kernel (look in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/), and value is the appropriate integer
for that feature.
.br
See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
for a description of all the possible IPv4 settings and their values.


.SH EXAMPLES
Remember, that the order that rules are specified in the interfaces.d/*
files matters.
.RS 4 .\" increase indent
# don't allow private addresses in this interface
.br
.br
policy in martians 
.br
policy in ACCEPT \-\-protocol 41 # allow IPv6 on IPv4
.br
policy in ACCEPT \-\-protocol tcp \-\-destination\-port ssh
.br
policy in ACCEPT \-\-protocol tcp \-\-destination\-port smtp
.br
policy in tcp\-strict
.br
policy in udp\-strict
.br
policy in icmp\-strict
.br
policy in REJECT # don't allow anything else
.br
.br
policy out martians
.br
policy out ACCEPT         # who we will talk to
.br
.br
# forward packets arriving on this interface?
.br
if_feature forwarding 0
.br
# log martian packets to syslog?
.br
if_feature log_martians 1
.RE .\" move left margin back to previous
.PP
See the sample entries in the
.I classes.d
directory.
.PP
.B Don't forget
to re-run
.B /usr/sbin/@PKGNAME@
for the rules to be re-loaded.
.PP
.B More Advanced Example
.br
This creates an empty ruleset with no rules in it, and then we can use
iptables as normal to add/delete rules to the chain. (This doesn't
hide the abstraction on top of iptables).
In a newly created
.IR ruleset.d/ssh_syn.rule :
.PP
.RS 4
# automatically create an empty 'ssh_syn' ruleset we can use
.br
. support/ruleset.functions
.RE
.PP
And in our
.I @CONFDIR@/interfaces.d/eth0.if
file:
.PP
.RS 4
\...
.br
policy in ssh_syn \-\-protocol tcp \\
.br
   \-\-destination\-port ssh \-\-syn
.br
\...
.RE
.PP
Then to add an ip address that we do not want to have ssh access:
.PP
.RS 4
iptables --append ssh_syn --source $ip --jump DROP
.RE
